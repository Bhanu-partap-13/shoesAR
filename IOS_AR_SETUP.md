# iOS AR Quick Look Setup

## What We've Done:
1. Created basic USDZ files for iOS AR Quick Look
2. Added fallback detection for missing/invalid USDZ files
3. Updated server to serve USDZ files with correct MIME type
4. Created HTML fallback for when USDZ isn't available

## How to Test:
1. Open the app on iOS Safari
2. Click "Try AR" on any shoe
3. Should attempt AR Quick Look first
4. Falls back to web AR if USDZ isn't available

## For Production:
To create proper USDZ files, use:
- Apple's Reality Converter app
- USD Python tools
- Blender with USD export
- Online GLB to USDZ converters

## Current Status:
- ✅ Basic USDZ files created
- ✅ Fallback system implemented
- ✅ Server MIME type configured
- ⚠️ USDZ files are basic (for production, use proper conversion tools)
